# automate_newsletter
This is part of the Hackathon event in Qxf2 for 2020.
We chose this idea "Automate Newsletter campaign". The aim was to collect all the shared articles from a Skype channel and make it useful for the Newsletter feed.

The python script which reads from the Skype channel messages has to be run manually. This also parses the messages with URLs and date of posting and writes the parsed data into a CSV file.

The Flask app is a simple app which displays the posted URLs and the posted Date in the form of a table.
